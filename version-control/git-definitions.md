The branches are an extension out from the main code, but can be altered and do not affect the main source unless they are merged.  You would use it when there are multiple answers to the same question, but from different users.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is when you store the contents of an index that you are working on and alows you to add a message describing your changs.  A good message is one that give a clear description of the changes that were made to the index.
