	<h2>Release 4: Reflect</h2>
<p>
	1.  The purpose of HTML5 Semantic tags are to let other coders that are working on your project to understand what the code means.  It helps to distinguish the different parts fo the page layout.  I think the most useful ones are section and nav.  Section because other semantic tags are found within it and nav because it shows where the navigation bar is.

	2. The browser displays elements from top to bottom of the code.  That means, even though you may have a semantic tag that reads footer at the top of your page, the page will still render the content at the top of the page, not the bottom.

	3. I learned that in sublime, you can create your own snippets.  Snippets are useful for creating a shortcut to fill in the basics of a code language.  Also, I learned that sublime is very intuitive at making sure that it will not open a snippet of a different document type, when document types are set. (if a snippet is set to open html docs, it will not prefill for a ruby doc.)  I think in the future, I will most definately utilize snippets.  They are huge shortcut that allows you to customize your own templates.

	4. I think the most difficult part of this challenge was understanding the semantic tags.  Since there is no actual content being changed on the page, I was not sure what they were used for.  Katy cleared up all the questons that I had on this topic.
